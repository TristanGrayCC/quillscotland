      On the eve of Glasgow Pride we have been disappointed to discover{" "}
      <a href="https://greens.scot/sites/default/files/Email%20exchange%20with%20Glasgows%20Pride%20Ltd.%20(Names%20Redacted%20for%20Privacy).pdf">
        an exchange
      </a>{" "}
      between the pride organisers and the Glasgow Green Party in which Glasgow
      Pride’s organisers put solidarity with corporate interests before
      intersectionality, and attack activists for such diverse causes as
      environmentalism and Palestinian solidarity as if they were traitors to
      the LGBTQ+ community.
      <br />
      <br />
      Most egregiously, they have attempted to single-handedly redefine the
      concept of “pinkwashing”, a well-understood concept referring to the
      corporate or national use of an image of friendliness to our community to
      distract from their wrongs.
      <br />
      <br />
      On their website: "Pride is and always has been about the LGBTQIA+
      Community, we do not support any form of pink washing by anyone, be this
      from brands or activist campaigns as this detracts from the focus of
      Equality and Inclusion of our Diverse community within society."
      <br />
      <br />
      There is no diversity in our community if protests that defend that
      diversity are attacked by those with authority, including Pride
      organisers. There is good reason that the Progress Flag moves beyond the
      rainbow to champion those specific communities that have been marginalised
      by us. Solidarity across lines of oppression is how we progress beyond
      Pride closing its doors to those most who are most oppressed, to not pull
      the ladder up behind those who believe the work of Pride has already been
      done.
      <br />
      <br />
      A quote from their response: “... pink or rainbow washing which by
      definition is a critical term used to refer to the practice of attempting
      to benefit from purported support for LGBTQ+ rights, often as a way to
      profit by brands who do not directly support our community or to pull
      attention to a separate agenda such as Just Stop Oil attempted during
      Pride in London, or as you are stating with the conflict in Gaza.”
      <br />
      <br />
      This brazen attempt to redefine “pinkwashing” in their own interests is
      beneath organisers in Pride occasions. Pinkwashing is not a new or
      misunderstood term. It refers specifically to the actions of corporations
      and political entities seeking to distract from their wrongdoings by
      displaying solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community.
      <br />
      <br />
      A further quote - “Any attempted to hijack or disrupt the events will be
      seen as being against the LGBTQIA+ community and attempted pinkwashing by
      distracting attention away from the challenges face by our community…
      “[Pride is] resistance to discrimination and violence specifically for the
      LGBTQIA+ community””
      <br />
      <br />
      An attempt to attack activists for daring to work in the name of all
      LGBTQ+ people, not only those privileged enough to believe they are not
      impacted by issues that threaten all of us such as climate change, or
      those whose human rights are directly and publicly being violated every
      day such as Palestinians facing starvation and death under bombardment,
      debases Pride. This statement comes within an inch of branding LGBTQ+
      activists as traitors to the community for their intersectional campaigns,
      and threatens to turn the backs of our community to those most in need. It
      attempts to rebrand Pride as being only for those within the community who
      face no other forms of oppression, and to leave those behind who might
      struggle under discrimination and marginalisation from multiple quarters.
      <br />
      <br />
      Our community is within those at risk from the actions of corporations
      funding climate devastation and weapons of war. Queer Palestinians being
      starved and skilled for being Palestinian are members of our community.
      Queer Fajians whose island homes are at risk of being wiped away by rising
      sea levels are members of our community. Queer Nigerians whose land is
      poisoned by the actions of multinational corporations are members of our
      community. Pride is for all of us, but it is <b>especially</b> for those
      most vulnerable among us, even when the source of their vulnerability
      doesn’t impact the most privileged among us.
      <br />
      <br />
      Further - “We will work with authorities to ensure that the event is
      carried out safely for attendees and ensure appropriate action is taken
      where required by the appropriate bodies.”
      <br />
      <br />
      The intent of this final line is clear. A threat against protest,
      weaponising state violence on their own behalf. Nothing could be more
      foreign to the ideals of Pride and the resistance to police violence that
      began it all at Stonewall in 1969.
